## About me 🙆🏼‍♂️

Hi! My name is Daniel I live in Hungary and currently I'm working in frontend with Angular, but I also like doing things on the backend and using other frameworks/libraries as well. 🔧

## This year's goals:

- Update portfolio, try new things with it like Nx
- Deep dive into advanced frontend architectures with Angular and Nx
- Make my own NeoVim configuration and its experience as smooth as possible
- Write stories on Medium about challenges and progress
- Try out some new technologies? :D
