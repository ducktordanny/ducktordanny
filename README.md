## About me 🙆🏼‍♂️

Hi! My name is Daniel I live in Hungary and I'm a Computer Science Engineer student at University of Pannonia (Veszprem), but also love to learn new things by myself. Currently I'm working in frontend with Angular, but I also like doing things on the backend and using other frameworks/libraries as well. 🔧

Furthermore you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ducktordanny) though I only use it occasionally.
